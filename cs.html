                <h2>Authorship Attribution</h2>

                <p>
                    Written language plays a significant role in our society. We continuously record information and communicate with others.
                    In today's day and age, the internet provides a veil of anonymity that at times becomes problematic and abused.
                    Various applications such as threats of violence, terrorism, hate speech, or harassment take advantage of this veil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, being able to identify authors has many practical applications, including being able to identify the author
                    of a patent in a lawsuit or solving historical mysteries.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started with downloading the 50-50 reuters dataset and gathering data from various other sources.
                    The goal is to be able to create a model that is not only accurate in classifing authors given documents,
                    but flexible in that no matter the form of writing the model can perform.
                    To start, I gathered about 130 Taylor Swift song lyrics and 130 Kanye West lyrics,
                    as these artists are drastically different, thus being an easy matchup for the model.
                    The next phase was 100 Rick Riordan excerpts versus 100 James Dashner excerpts, as both are well known for
                    writing popular pre teen fantasy novels.
                </p>

                <img alt="rnn" src="assets/rnn.png" class = "image rnn"/>

                <p>
                    For the model, I used an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), a neural network that takes information from
                    previous inputs, giving it the quality of "memory" and making it effective for NLP related tasks such as
                    this one. Additionally, I used an AdamW Optimizer, as it is typically the most effective optimizer and
                    a learning rate scheduler to reduce the learning rate every few epochs.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    While the training loss reduced and the validation loss was rather stagnant, the accuracy on the testing
                    data is 73% for both Kanye West and Taylor Swift files. The learning rate was relatively low, as the
                    model would otherwise be relatively unstable.
                </p>

                    <img alt="Loss Graph" src="assets/jamesRickLoss.PNG" class = "graph jrLoss"/>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The model performed relatively similarly for James Dashner vs Rick Riordan. However, unexpectedly the model was able
                    to perform better with 73% accuracy for James Dashner and 83% for Rick Riordan. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are strong ethical implications with an NLP model that can successfully de-anonymize documents.
                    This could be used to troll, doxx, or stalk those that use the internet's anonymity defensively. Worse,
                    Authoritarian Governments can track down anonymous jouranlists. Thus, a solution would be to combine
                    the model with a hate speech classifier so that the model can only be used to track hate speech.
                    As the model becomes popular, it can be expanded to be used for other applications. Check out my

                <h2>Image Compression</h2>

                <p>
                    In an older project, I used various techniques I learned from my intro to ML class in order to compress images.
                    None of these methods were implemented with the help of pre-existing implementations from packages such as sklearning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This first method utilizes SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). An image is essentially a matrix of pixel values.
                    We then decompose the matrix into three different matrices using linear algebra techniques and essentially reduce the size of the matrices.
                    For colored images, you store red, green, and blue values into three matrices and have to perform SVD for each matrix. Here are the results:
                </p>

                <img alt="svd" src="assets/svd.png" class = "image svd"/>

                <p>
                    This next method uses GMM (Gaussian Mixture Modeling). It utilizes clusters and gives each point a probability the point is in each cluster.
                    First, GMM estimates which clusters each point is most likely to be a part of.
                    Afterwards, it figures out which cluster each point belongs to by calculating and maximizing the likelihood a point belongs to a cluster.
                    Here are the results:
